Hey There! My name is Artie Humphreys and I'm currently a student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Virginia. I'm an aspiring computer scientist, focusing on creating highly-performant software, and designing elegant algorithms to solve real-world problems.

I was inspired to create this blog by my colleague, <a href="https://barrettruth.com/">
Barrett Ruth,</a> who has constantly challenged me to become a better problem solver by
rigorously scrutinizing my algorithm correctness proofs and pushing my
understanding of complex topics. He has been an invaluable mentor during my time
at UVA, and I'm deeply grateful for his guidance.

The point of this blog is to inspire as much as it is to educate. Every great solution
begins with a "Why?" For example, "Why does this approach work?" or "Why is this
system designed this way?" It's one thing to gain a surface level understanding of
a topic, but diving one layer deeper—to uncover the principles, trade‑offs, and hidden
motivations behind the code—is where real insight lives.

Below is a collection of blog entries from my personal exploration, covering a wide
range of topics. I strive for clarity and accuracy, so if you catch any mistakes or have feedback, please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ah.artiehumphreys@gmail.com">ah.artiehumphreys@gmail.com</a>.
