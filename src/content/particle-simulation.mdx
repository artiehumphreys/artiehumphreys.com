The world of physics and mathematics are greatly intertwined. It is very much a two-way
relationship, where mathematical concepts can be used to describe physical phenomena,
and physical experiments can lead to new mathematical insights. The goal of this
project was to explore this relationship by creating a particle simulator, giving
me the avenue to dive deeper with C++ optimization and object-oriented design and
create something that interests me as a software developer.

First,
