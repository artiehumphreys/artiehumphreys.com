This problem is straightforward. We simply print the first character
of the three input strings (via ```string::front()```). Nothing crazy here
since the strings are guaranteed to be non-empty.

This problem is also somewhat straightforward. Reducing the problem statement, we are
given a range $$[l, r]$$ that has been infected over $$n$$ days with $$r - l = n$$.
We need to determine, given $$m \leq n$$, any valid subrange that overlaps with $$0$$
since the virus begins there and progresses to neighboring cells from there.
To ensure that our interval overlaps with $$0$$, we can fix
our right endpoint to be $$\min(r, m)$$. This ensures that the left endpoint is
$$\min(r, m) - m \leq 0$$. Thus, our answer is $$[\min(r, m) - m, \min(r, m)]$$.

This problem took me a while to understand, but the implementation follows easily
once the insight is found. This will be the case for many competitive programming
problems, so don't be discouraged if you don't immediately see the solution.
