People throw around the term "big O" a lot in the world of computer science.
Big O notation as a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm is important, but
it doesn't always tell the whole story. For example, a linear scan
through a small array 
(<a href="https://dirtyhandscoding.wordpress.com/2017/08/25/performance-comparison-linear-search-vs-binary-search/" target="_blank">less than a few hundred elements</a>)
can be faster than a binary search, even though the binary search is $$O(lg \space n)$$ and the
linear scan is $$O(n)$$. Big O notation is a useful abstraction for measuring the
amount of operations performed by an algorithm, but it doesn't always capture
the real-world performance of an algorithm. Thus, when optimizing code, it's
important to measure the actual performance of your code and get your hands dirty
with profiling tools, rather than relying on theory alone.
